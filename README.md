## Dot Plot

### Introduction

The Dot Plot program generates a visual representation of the relationship between two DNA sequences using a dot plot. Dot plots are widely used in bioinformatics to identify similarities, repeats, and other patterns in biological sequences.

### Usage

To use the Dot Plot program, you need to provide two DNA sequences as input. The program will then generate a dot plot to visualize the relationships between these sequences.

### Installation

No installation is required to use the Dot Plot program. Simply download the Python script and execute it using a Python interpreter.

### Example

```python
import dot_plot

# Define two DNA sequences
sequence1 = "ATCGATCGATCG"
sequence2 = "ATCGATAGCTAG"

# Generate dot plot
dot_plot.plot(sequence1, sequence2)
```

## ORFs (Open Reading Frames)

### Introduction

The ORFs program identifies and extracts Open Reading Frames (ORFs) from a given DNA sequence. ORFs are sequences of DNA that have the potential to encode proteins.

### Usage

To use the ORFs program, provide a DNA sequence as input. The program will then search for ORFs within the sequence and return their start and end positions, along with the ORF sequences.

### Installation

No installation is required to use the ORFs program. Simply download the Python script and execute it using a Python interpreter.

### Example

```python
import orfs_finder

# Define DNA sequence
dna_sequence = "ATGAGCTAGCTAGTAA"

# Find ORFs
orfs = orfs_finder.find_orfs(dna_sequence)

# Print ORFs
for start, end, sequence in orfs:
    print(f"Start: {start}, End: {end}, Sequence: {sequence}")
```

## Testing

### Introduction

The Testing module contains stress tests and unit tests for the Dot Plot and ORFs programs to ensure their functionality and reliability.

### Usage

To run the tests, execute the test script provided for each program. The tests will verify that the programs produce the expected output for different input scenarios.

### Installation

No installation is required to run the tests. Simply download the test scripts and execute them using a Python interpreter.

### Example

```bash
python test_dot_plot.py
python test_orfs.py
```

### Note

Make sure to provide appropriate input data for the tests to validate the functionality of the programs effectively.
